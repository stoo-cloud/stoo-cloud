- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **Stoo** and I am exploring devops and architecture in the **Cloud** :cloud:
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/why-google-cloud) and have the GCP [Professtional Cloud Architect](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-architect) certification.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying GCP [Professional Network Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-network-engineer) and GCP [Professional Devops Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-devops-engineer)
- I have been running Linux and Gnome as a work desktop for 20+ years, and have been using MacOs at home.
